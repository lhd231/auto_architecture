# auto_architecture

A way to build pytorch models automatically by creating dictionaries of pointers to functions.

Running:
make_hp_dicts.py explains how to make new dictionaries of architectures
utility_models.py and utility_funcs.py are where you can write the code for new layers/functionality.
runner.py and test.py show examples of how to run the model with training loops.
